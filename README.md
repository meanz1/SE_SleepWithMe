# üí§ Sleep with me
This project was made for the Software Engineering course at Hanyang University.<div>
## Abstract
Modern people habitually watch videos through the media before sleeping. The Corona Blue phenomenon caused by COVID-19 intensified people's irregular sleep patterns, and more people couldn't sleep before going to bed and watched videos until late at night. Our team aimed to create an application that automatically provides people with the necessary functions before and after sleep, targeting LG's mobile monitor "Stand by me." Our application not only provides video recommendations and power control so that users can fall asleep, but also provides a function to maintain regular sleep time. Therefore, this helps users maintain their lifestyle. And we maximized the convenience of users by automating the functions of the application.

## Proposal
Modern people use electronic devices such as smartphones in their bedrooms before going to bed.It is known that the habit of using electronic devices before going to bed interferes with sleep. However, there are many people who can't stop even though they know this. This is because there are many people who can't stop watching their smartphones before going to bed, thinking that it's better to look at their smartphones than tossing and turning while they can't sleep.

But what about electronic devices that help me sleep, rather than interfere with sleep? In fact, many people recognize the need for a good night's sleep, so they look up videos that help them sleep on YouTube or install and use sleep management apps.

Our team devised Sleep with Me, which utilizes the advantages of LG's mobile TV Stand by Me. "Sleep with me" is an app linked to "Stand by me," which helps people get a comfortable sleep and have regular sleep patterns. In this paper, we will look at the main customer base of "Sleep with me" and the current market status that supports Sleep-tech. Based on this, I will explain the main role of "Sleep with me".

  
## Target Users
we looked at the needs of the main customer base of "Stand by me," which succeeded in business feasibility. As mentioned in 1.1, we focused on 1) "Stand by me"'s property that can be used until sleep because it is mobile TV, 2) the majority of modern people's main TV viewing time is late at night after work, 3) not only those who are currently suffering from insomnia, but also those who want to be guaranteed regular sleep time even if they sleep well. Therefore, we set the user keyword of "Sleep with me" as "sleep". Since Sleep with me is an app that is linked to Stand by me, which is mainly used at home, end- user will be individuals at home.
  
## Goal
a. It presents ideas using TV, the most commonly used LG home appliance just before going to bed.
Most people fall asleep watching TV. Focusing on this point, we would like to propose ‚ÄòSleep with Me‚Äô, which can help induce sleep and identify sleep patterns on TV without using wearable devices to prevent disturbance to sleep.
    
b. It is intended to identify the user's sleep pattern by identifying the starting and ending points of the sleep time before bedtime.
It provides a UI that allows users to check their sleep patterns through ‚ÄòSleep with me‚Äô, collect data, and easily check the data so that they can regularly manage and grasp their sleep patterns.
    
c. The function is automatically terminated during sleep time so that 'Sleep with me' does not interfere with sleep. If the TV monitor is operated while users are sleeping, it
may interfere with sleep. Therefore, after being counted as the sleep start time, I would like to propose an automatic turn-off mode that can be automatically turned off without the user turning off the TV or setting the time himself.
    
d. Taking advantage of TV's advantages, AI technology and IoT are utilized using monitor screens and sounds.
‚ÄòSleep with me‚Äô supports personalized video services that can induce sleep and enables language commands through natural language recognition. In addition, when linking with a mobile phone application through an IoT function, it provides convenience to enable alarm service and mode setting on a mobile phone.
